# RADStudioStyles
RAD Studio 10.3 Rio introduced new Light and Dark VCL styles.  These styles have been extracted directly from the application's files.

*Note: The FMX styles were converted from VCL styles, and may be buggy.*

### License
I'm honestly not even sure if extracting these is "allowed".  I don't care what you do with them - take your chances.
